This project provides a comprehensive, end-to-end pipeline for collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing performance data for cricket players. It demonstrates skills in data acquisition (web scraping), data transformation (Python/Pandas), and business intelligence (Power BI).



The goal is to transform raw, unstructured data from the web into actionable insights about player and team performance.



🛠️ Technology Stack

Data Acquisition (Web Scraping): javascript in both interaction code and parser code and used Bright data to collect data

Data Processing & Analysis: Python (Pandas )

Business Intelligence & Visualization: Power BI

Version Control: Git



📈 Data Source

The data is sourced directly from a public cricket statistics website  ESPNcricinfo, Cricbuzz, and similar via web scraping.



Key Pipeline Steps and Deliverables

This project highlights a complete data analytics lifecycle:

Web Scraping & Data Extraction:

Implementation: Developed a Python script to automatically scrape tabular cricket statistics (e.g., batting averages, strike rates, bowling wickets) from specified web pages.

Data Structure: Structured the raw scraped data into a clean, machine-readable format (e.g., CSV or Excel).

Data Cleaning and Transformation (ETL):

Handling Missing Data: Identified and addressed any missing or inconsistent values in the raw dataset.

Feature Engineering: Calculated derived metrics relevant to cricket analysis (e.g., calculating Player Efficiency Index, converting raw runs/wickets into per-match averages).

Data Type Conversion: Ensured all columns (runs, wickets, matches) were correctly typed as numeric values for analysis.

Data Modeling (Power BI Preparation):

Prepared the cleaned data model for importation into Power BI.

Established relationships between different datasets .

Interactive Visualization (Power BI Dashboard):

Creation: Designed and built a dynamic Power BI dashboard.

Key Insights: The dashboard presents visual analytics such as:

Top Performers based on selected metrics (like highest run-scorers, best strike-rates).

Performance trends over time or across different formats (Test, ODI, T20).

Comparison charts of key players.




📖 Learning & Development

Developing this project provided hands-on experience in:

Building a reliable data acquisition layer using Python for real-world data sources.

Mastering complex Pandas operations for data aggregation and transformation.

Designing an effective business intelligence dashboard that translates complex data into simple, visual narratives.

Understanding the specific data requirements and metrics used in professional cricket analysis.
